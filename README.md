# Assigment 2


## Description

> **Due Date**: Week 11, Friday the 16th of May, 23:59 AEST  
> **Weight**: 25% of the final subject mark  
> **Submission**: Submit your presentation recording and final report on Canvas

### Group Assignment
- This is a **group assignment** for **teams of two** students.
- Teams of one or three must email the unit coordinator at [lijun.chang@sydney.edu.au](mailto:lijun.chang@sydney.edu.au) for approval.

---

## Objective

Apply graph analysis techniques to investigate a **real-world dataset** of your choice. The goal is to:
- Identify and analyze the underlying **network structure**,
- Draw **meaningful and non-trivial insights**,
- Present findings in a **comprehensive report**.

---

## Assignment Tasks

### Task 1: Dataset Selection
- Identify and obtain a **real-world dataset** from an external source.

### Task 2: Research Question or Hypothesis Formulation
- Develop a **clear and focused research question or hypothesis** for investigation.
- Justify the relevance of your question to the dataset and its potential for meaningful graph analysis.

### Task 3: Graph Construction
- Convert the dataset into a graph (if not already in graph form).
- Clearly specify:
  - **Nodes**: What entities are represented?
  - **Edges**: What relationships or interactions define them?
  - **Attributes**: Are there any attributes on nodes/edges? What are they?
- Justify your design choices in relation to the research question.

### Task 4: Graph Analysis
- Apply appropriate graph analysis techniques to explore the network.
- Possible techniques include (but are not limited to):
  - Centrality measures (node importance)
  - Community or cluster detection
  - Temporal analysis of network dynamics (if applicable)
  - Path analysis and reachability
- Justify how each technique aids in uncovering meaningful insights.

### Task 5: Insightful Observations and Interpretation
- Critically examine your graph analysis results.
- Interpret findings in the context of your research question:
  - Do they support, refute, or refine your assumptions?
- Explain how insights contribute to understanding the dataset.
- Link interpretations to domain knowledge, real-world applications, or theoretical implications.

## Deliverables

### 1. PDF Report (4–6 pages, excluding optional cover page, references, appendix)
Must include:
1. Brief introduction to the dataset and its graph representation
2. Clear research question/hypothesis and its relevance
3. Methodology for graph construction and analysis (with justification)
4. Key results and interpretations
5. Insightful conclusions and broader implications
6. Reflections on limitations and future work
7. References to datasets, tools, and sources
8. Appendix: short paragraph detailing each team member's contribution

> **Note:** Teams of 3 must formulate **two or more** research questions or hypotheses (with associated methodology, results, etc.) using the same dataset.

### 2. Presentation
- Slides in **PDF, PPT, or PPTX**
- Recorded presentation in **MP4 format** (4–8 minutes)
  - Must display:
    - Speaker
    - Presentation slides
  - Should cover points 1–6 from the report

### 3. Supplementary Materials
- Separate ZIP file containing:
  - Well-organized and documented code scripts
  - Raw datasets
