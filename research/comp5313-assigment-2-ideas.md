Great, I'll look into the best ways to model developer interactions in large GitHub open-source projects using NetworkX, with a focus on temporal dynamics and potential evidence of coordination headwind. I’ll also suggest suitable graph metrics that capture the rate of change and network complexity as contributor count grows. I’ll let you know as soon as I have a comprehensive overview.

# Modeling Developer Interactions in Large OSS Projects

## Representing Developer Interaction Networks

Open-source projects generate rich collaboration data that can be modeled as a graph (network) of developers. In such a **developer interaction network**, each node represents a developer, and an edge denotes some form of interaction or collaboration between two developers. Effective ways to model these interactions include:

- **Co-Commit/Co-Edit Networks:** Connect two developers if they have both contributed to the same code artifact (e.g., file, module, or repository) within a given timeframe. This captures coordination needs arising from working on related code. For example, researchers have built *co-change networks* by linking developers who commit to the same file or feature ([Classifying Core Developers in Open-Source Software Projects](https://www.se.cs.uni-saarland.de/theses/PhilippScholtesBA.pdf#:~:text=In%20this%20thesis%2C%20we%20construct,group%20by%20their%20characteristics%20and)). This reflects implicit coordination (developers likely need to communicate or at least be aware of each other when modifying the same parts of the code).
- **Issue and PR Collaboration Networks:** Connect developers based on direct interactions in the project’s issue tracker or pull request reviews. For instance, if developer A reviews or comments on developer B’s pull request, or if two developers discuss the same issue, create an edge between them. In essence, the issue/PR thread acts as a meeting point for developer interactions. Prior work constructs such *communication networks* from issue data ([Classifying Core Developers in Open-Source Software Projects](https://www.se.cs.uni-saarland.de/theses/PhilippScholtesBA.pdf#:~:text=In%20this%20thesis%2C%20we%20construct,group%20by%20their%20characteristics%20and)), treating developers as connected if they participate in the same discussion.
- **Combined Interaction Graphs:** It’s also possible to integrate multiple interaction types. An edge could represent any significant collaboration: co-commits, code reviews, or mutual issue comments. Edges might be weighted by interaction frequency (e.g., number of PRs reviewed or files co-edited) to distinguish strong collaboration ties from weaker ones. Initially, using an unweighted, undirected graph is simplest – treat any collaboration as an undirected edge – and later incorporate weights or direction if deeper analysis requires it.
- **Affiliation Networks:** Alternatively, model a bipartite network between developers and artifacts (files, commits, or issues) and then project it to a developer-developer graph. For example, a bipartite graph of developers linked to the issues they commented on can be projected so that two developers share an edge if they commented on at least one common issue. This is analogous to how one might connect two researchers who authored a paper together, but here the “paper” is a code artifact or discussion thread.

When constructing these networks, **NetworkX** (a Python library) can be used to accumulate interactions over time. One can parse the project’s git history and GitHub data (commits, PRs, issues) to extract relationships. Data sources like the *GH Archive* or **GHTorrent** provide comprehensive, timestamped records of GitHub events ([Understanding Influence in GitHub’s Open-Source Developer Community | by Danyil Butkovskyi | INST414: Data Science Techniques | Mar, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/inst414-data-science-tech/understanding-influence-in-githubs-open-source-developer-community-05893aa40609#:~:text=I%20collected%20data%20from%20the,in%20gzip%20and%20json%20modules)) ([](https://gousios.org/pub/ghtorrent-dataset-toolsuite.pdf#:~:text=3,and%20promotion%3A%20Researchers%20often%20ask)). Using such data, you can build a graph for each period by adding nodes (developers) and edges whenever a qualifying interaction occurs. NetworkX provides convenient functions to add edges and to calculate various graph metrics (clustering coefficients, centralities, path lengths, etc.). It’s wise to maintain consistent node identifiers (e.g. GitHub usernames) so that a developer’s node can be tracked across snapshots.

## Temporal Slicing of Collaboration Networks

To study coordination over time, we need to slice the project timeline into snapshots and build a series of graphs (one per time window). **Choosing an appropriate temporal granularity** is important:

- **Fixed Interval Snapshots:** A common approach is to use a regular interval such as weekly, monthly, or quarterly snapshots. Each snapshot includes interactions that occurred in that period. For long-running projects spanning years, using coarser slices (e.g. monthly or quarterly) is advisable to reduce noise ([Exploring temporal community evolution: algorithmic approaches and parallel optimization for dynamic community detection | Applied Network Science | Full Text](https://appliednetsci.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s41109-023-00592-1#:~:text=Depending%20on%20the%20timestamp%20value,for%20the%20number%20of%20snapshots)). Monthly snapshots are a popular choice for active projects, as they balance temporal resolution with having enough interactions per slice. Weekly snapshots may be too fine-grained unless the project has very high activity. Conversely, if analyzing a decade of evolution, one might even use yearly snapshots for broad trends ([Exploring temporal community evolution: algorithmic approaches and parallel optimization for dynamic community detection | Applied Network Science | Full Text](https://appliednetsci.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s41109-023-00592-1#:~:text=Depending%20on%20the%20timestamp%20value,for%20the%20number%20of%20snapshots)).
- **Milestone or Release-based Slices:** Another slicing strategy is to align snapshots with the project’s release cycle or major milestones. For example, build a network for each major release version. This approach was used in a case study of the Angular project, where the developer network was constructed for each major version from v2 through v11 ([
            Structural stability of the evolving developer collaboration network in the OSS community - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9269872/#:~:text=version%20sequence%2C%20we%20construct%20the,and%20may%20provide%20a%20reference)) ([
            Structural stability of the evolving developer collaboration network in the OSS community - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9269872/#:~:text=Fig%202%20shows%20the%20variation,collaboration%20networks%20in%20OSS%20communities)). The advantage is that each snapshot corresponds to a meaningful state of the software, potentially aligning network changes with development phases or team re-organizations.
- **Sliding Windows:** Instead of disjoint slices, one can use a sliding window (e.g. a 3-month rolling window advanced monthly). This captures evolving interactions more smoothly and can highlight trends without abrupt boundary effects. For instance, a window could include interactions from the past *N* weeks up to that time point, providing overlapping networks that slowly evolve.
- **Cumulative vs. Periodic Networks:** Decide whether each snapshot shows only new interactions in that period or the cumulative state up to that point. Typically, for studying the *evolution*, it’s best to use non-cumulative (period-specific) networks, so that changes in metrics reflect recent coordination structure. However, cumulative networks (where edges persist once formed) can be useful to show the aggregate social network at that point in time (e.g., “by the end of 2022, how connected was the team?”). In practice, one might start with period-specific graphs to see short-term coordination dynamics, and additionally examine the cumulative network growth (which tends to be non-decreasing in edges).
- **Consistency and Duration:** Ensure each snapshot covers comparable duration (if using time-based slices) so metrics are comparable. If the project has seasons of inactivity, you might adjust slice length or focus on active periods. It’s also important to track the number of active contributors in each snapshot, since many graph metrics are sensitive to network size ([Analyzing Developer Networks Based on GitHub Issue Data](https://www.se.cs.uni-saarland.de/theses/RaphaelNoemmerBA.pdf#:~:text=consistent,We%20conclude%20that)).

**Example – Major Release Snapshots:** In the Angular OSS project study, the authors created a developer collaboration graph at each major version release. They observed significant churn in membership at each version (20–87% of developers in one version were newcomers, and 50–70% from the previous version left by the next) ([
            Structural stability of the evolving developer collaboration network in the OSS community - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9269872/#:~:text=Fig%202%20shows%20the%20variation,collaboration%20networks%20in%20OSS%20communities)). This justified treating each version as a separate snapshot. Despite the turnover, each snapshot still formed a large connected component (over 80% of developers remained connected) ([
            Structural stability of the evolving developer collaboration network in the OSS community - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9269872/#:~:text=Table%201%20lists%20the%20basic,each%20member%20is%20relatively%20stable)) – indicating that new contributors were integrating into the main collaboration network rather than working in isolation. Such insights underscore the value of temporal slicing: we can see how network structure adapts as people join or leave.

## Graph Metrics for Coordination Complexity

Once the developer interaction graphs are built for each time slice, we can compute a range of **network metrics** using NetworkX to quantify coordination structure and complexity. The following metrics are particularly relevant to detecting coordination slowdowns or the “coordination headwind” as a project grows:

- **Graph Density and Average Degree:** *Density* is the fraction of possible pairs of developers that are connected (edges) in the network. Equivalently, monitor the average degree (the average number of collaborators per developer). As more contributors join, it’s unlikely every new pair of developers will communicate; coordination tends to saturate. A declining density (or roughly constant average degree) with growing team size is expected ([
            Structural stability of the evolving developer collaboration network in the OSS community - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9269872/#:~:text=Table%201%20lists%20the%20basic,each%20member%20is%20relatively%20stable)). For instance, in Angular’s network the average degree stayed around ~5 even as the number of developers varied from ~120 to ~300 ([
            Structural stability of the evolving developer collaboration network in the OSS community - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9269872/#:~:text=Table%201%20lists%20the%20basic,each%20member%20is%20relatively%20stable)). This means each developer interacts with a limited set of peers; the proportion of all possible connections shrinks. A **sharply dropping density** might indicate that new contributors are not integrating well (forming few links), whereas steady average degree suggests the project’s collaboration capacity per person remains about the same. Extremely low density or many isolated nodes could signal coordination breakdowns (contributors working siloed).
- **Clustering Coefficient (Transitivity):** This measures the tendency of developers to form triads (closed loops of three). The **global clustering coefficient** (or transitivity) is the ratio of closed triplets to all triplets in the network. A high clustering means developers’ collaboration partners are also collaborating with each other (forming tightly-knit subgroups). A **local clustering coefficient** can be computed for each developer and averaged. In a software context, moderate clustering indicates sub-teams or common areas of work where everyone knows everyone else. Changes in clustering over time can reveal shifts in team structure: 
  - If clustering **drops** as the team grows, it could mean the network is becoming more star-like (newcomers only connect to a central maintainer, but not to each other) – potentially a warning of communication bottlenecks where a central person mediates many relationships.
  - If clustering **rises**, it might indicate the formation of more cohesive subgroups (developers intensely collaborating among themselves). High clustering in pockets could mean knowledge silos or efficient small teams – interpreting it requires context.
  - One study found that the global clustering coefficient can vary inexplicably between projects and did not simply scale with network size ([Analyzing Developer Networks Based on GitHub Issue Data](https://www.se.cs.uni-saarland.de/theses/RaphaelNoemmerBA.pdf#:~:text=global%20clustering%20coefficient%20,determine%20the%20cause%20of%20this)). This suggests using clustering in combination with other metrics. Still, a significantly **lower global clustering** in later snapshots compared to earlier ones might imply that the growing team has fewer triads, possibly reflecting that newcomers collaborate mainly with a subset of core devs rather than forming new triangles.
- **Network Centralization (Hub Dependence):** Examine whether the network becomes dominated by a few hub nodes as it grows. **Centrality metrics** (like degree centrality, betweenness centrality) identify influential developers:
  - *Degree centralization:* Are a small number of developers connected to a large fraction of the team? If as contributors increase, only a few maintainers review all code or interact with everyone, you’ll see a highly skewed degree distribution (a few very high-degree nodes). This can be quantified by the Gini coefficient of degree, or comparing max degree to mean. A rise in this skew over time might indicate increasing coordination load on key individuals (a possible coordination bottleneck).
  - *Betweenness centrality:* This measures how often a node lies on shortest paths between others. If the project relies on certain “gatekeepers” or communication brokers, those nodes will have high betweenness. Increasing average betweenness or concentration of betweenness in top nodes over time would suggest that communication paths are funneling through specific people (risking **bus factor** issues and delays if those people become overloaded).
  - *Eigenvector centrality or PageRank:* These identify if a few developers are not just high-degree, but connected to other well-connected devs (influence). An increasing gap between the top centrality scores and the rest could imply an emerging hierarchy or a core-periphery split.
- **Average Shortest Path Length (Communication Distance):** This metric (often denoted *L*) is the average number of hops it takes to reach one developer from another through the network’s edges. In a well-coordinated team (especially small ones), *L* is low – developers are either directly connected or just one intermediary away. As networks grow, *L* can increase (more “degrees of separation”). The **coordination headwind** might manifest as a growth in path length – information has to traverse more people, which can slow down problem-solving. However, many collaboration networks remain **small-world**: meaning *L* grows sub-linearly with team size (often logarithmically). For example, in Angular’s evolving network, the average shortest-path was essentially stable (when normalized against a random graph of same size, L ≈ 1) even as contributors fluctuated ([
            Structural stability of the evolving developer collaboration network in the OSS community - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9269872/#:~:text=Fig%203%20illustrates%20the%20characteristics,be%20observed%20that%20both%20networks)). This indicates the project maintained short communication paths by adding connecting edges appropriately. If you observe *L* increasing significantly over time (e.g., from ~2 to ~4 hops on average), that could be evidence that the project’s communication is becoming less efficient – perhaps due to formation of disjoint clusters or overloaded intermediaries. It’s important to compute this on the giant (largest) component of the network, since isolated individuals are not reachable (or you can treat distance between disconnected nodes as infinite for theoretical calculations).
- **Modularity (Community Structure):** Modularity $Q$ measures the strength of division of the network into modules or communities. A high modularity means the graph can be clearly partitioned into groups with dense internal connections and sparse ties between groups. In an OSS project, modules might correspond to sub-teams or logical components (e.g., front-end vs back-end contributors). As the number of contributors increases, one might expect **modularity to increase** if the project work naturally divides among more specialized teams. A moderate rise in modularity could indicate healthy division of labor (e.g., the project scaled by organizing into subgroups). However, a **very high modularity** (with very few bridging connections between modules) could also hint at siloing and coordination challenges across teams. In the Angular network, the modularity stayed relatively low (below 0.7) across versions, indicating that while some community structure existed, the project wasn’t fractured into isolated sub-teams ([
            Structural stability of the evolving developer collaboration network in the OSS community - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9269872/#:~:text=Fig%203%20illustrates%20the%20characteristics,be%20observed%20that%20both%20networks)). In fact, the network maintained a **“modular small-world” structure** – identifiable communities, but still plenty of cross-links via core developers – which is considered an efficient structure (local cohesion combined with global connectivity) ([
            Structural stability of the evolving developer collaboration network in the OSS community - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9269872/#:~:text=stability%20during%20network%20evolution,protection%20strategies%20for%20core%20developers)).
- **Connected Components and Core-Periphery Structure:** Another basic indicator is whether the collaboration network remains mostly one piece. A single giant connected component containing the majority of developers implies the project has a cohesive collaboration graph (even if divided into communities within). If over time the network splits into multiple sizeable components (e.g., a subproject team that never interacts with another), that’s a red flag for coordination breakdown. Empirical studies note that successful OSS communities tend to maintain a large connected core of contributors ([
            Structural stability of the evolving developer collaboration network in the OSS community - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9269872/#:~:text=Table%201%20lists%20the%20basic,each%20member%20is%20relatively%20stable)) ([
            Structural stability of the evolving developer collaboration network in the OSS community - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9269872/#:~:text=network%20of%20successful%20OSS%20communities,to%20the%20success%20of%20OSS)). You can track the size of the largest connected component (as a fraction of total nodes) in each snapshot. If that fraction declines as new contributors join, it suggests newcomers are not connecting to the existing team (perhaps only submitting drive-by contributions without engaging). A stable or growing giant component size (often remaining >80% of nodes) indicates new people are being integrated into the main collaboration web ([
            Structural stability of the evolving developer collaboration network in the OSS community - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9269872/#:~:text=Table%201%20lists%20the%20basic,each%20member%20is%20relatively%20stable)). Additionally, identifying a **core-periphery** pattern (a densely connected core of long-term developers vs. a sparse periphery of occasional contributors) can be insightful. Network metrics like *k-core decomposition* or *degree distribution* over time will show if the core is expanding or if the periphery is growing faster (which might increase coordination overhead on the core). Many projects rely on a “cohesive core” of hubs and connectors that hold the network together as it scales ([
            Structural stability of the evolving developer collaboration network in the OSS community - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9269872/#:~:text=stability%20during%20network%20evolution,protection%20strategies%20for%20core%20developers)). If that core thins out relative to the size of the periphery, coordination inefficiencies might arise.

**Figure 1** below illustrates some of these metrics in practice, using the Angular project’s developer network as an example of an evolving collaboration graph. In the top-left plot, the **global clustering coefficient** (C, black ●) and **average path length** (L, red ▲) are shown for successive versions (v2 through v11), each compared to a random graph baseline. The bottom-left plot shows the **modularity** (Q) of the network vs a random baseline. The right side depicts the network structure for two versions (v2 and v8), with nodes colored by community (module) to visualize modular structure:

 ([
            Structural stability of the evolving developer collaboration network in the OSS community - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9269872/)) *Fig. 1: Evolution of key network metrics (clustering C, path length L, modularity Q) for the Angular OSS developer network across versions v2–v11, and sample network graphs for two versions. The project maintained a modular small-world structure as it grew, with clustering (C) above random and path length (L) near the random baseline (indicating short paths) ([
            Structural stability of the evolving developer collaboration network in the OSS community - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9269872/#:~:text=Fig%203%20illustrates%20the%20characteristics,be%20observed%20that%20both%20networks)).*

From this example, we observe that as the contributor count changed, the **average shortest path remained roughly constant** (L stays near 1.0 relative to random), meaning the network did *not* become significantly “longer” in communication distance despite growth. The **clustering coefficient** initially rose and then declined by later versions (v8–v11) while still staying higher than a random network of similar size, and **modularity** increased moderately (peaking around 0.6). This suggests that by v8 the project’s contributors had organized into more defined sub-communities (higher Q) with slightly less global clustering, yet the presence of cross-module connectors kept communication paths short ([
            Structural stability of the evolving developer collaboration network in the OSS community - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9269872/#:~:text=Fig%203%20illustrates%20the%20characteristics,be%20observed%20that%20both%20networks)). In other words, Angular’s team scaled by forming modules but also maintaining enough inter-module links (through core developers acting as “hubs” and “connectors” ([
            Structural stability of the evolving developer collaboration network in the OSS community - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9269872/#:~:text=stability%20during%20network%20evolution,protection%20strategies%20for%20core%20developers))) to preserve a small-world topology. This kind of pattern – **many local clusters bridged by a few central people** – is commonly seen in large, successful OSS projects and can mitigate coordination headwinds by balancing specialization with integration.

## Prior Studies and Tools for Analyzing GitHub Collaboration Networks

There is a growing body of research applying social network analysis to GitHub and other OSS communities, which can guide metric selection and interpretation:

- **Modular Small-World Structures in OSS:** Successful open-source projects often exhibit “modular small-world” networks, as seen above. Peng et al. (2022) found that Angular’s developer network consistently maintained a small-world, economically modular structure throughout its evolution ([
            Structural stability of the evolving developer collaboration network in the OSS community - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9269872/#:~:text=stability%20during%20network%20evolution,protection%20strategies%20for%20core%20developers)). A cohesive core of developers (hubs and connectors) played a key role in linking modules, ensuring knowledge flowed across the project ([
            Structural stability of the evolving developer collaboration network in the OSS community - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9269872/#:~:text=stability%20during%20network%20evolution,protection%20strategies%20for%20core%20developers)). This structure is believed to enhance efficiency: it achieves a trade-off between local efficiency (within modules) and global efficiency (across modules) ([
            Structural stability of the evolving developer collaboration network in the OSS community - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9269872/#:~:text=We%20further%20test%20the%20efficiency,at%20the%20local%20and%20global)) ([
            Structural stability of the evolving developer collaboration network in the OSS community - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9269872/#:~:text=small,module%20links%2C%20which%20is%20key)). The implication for coordination is that as long as such a topology is maintained, adding more contributors does not drastically increase coordination overhead – the network self-organizes to keep paths short and cluster collaborators by areas of interest.
- **Evidence of Coordination Overhead:** On the flip side, classic software engineering wisdom (e.g., *Brooks’ Law*) warns that adding manpower can raise communication overhead disproportionately. Larger teams “lead to higher communication and coordination costs” ([The Relationship Between Software Development Team Size and Software Development Cost – Communications of the ACM](https://cacm.acm.org/research/the-relationship-between-software-development-team-size-and-software-development-cost/#:~:text=development%20projects%20continues%20to%20be,emphasize%20that%20diverse%20expertise%20in)). In network terms, the number of potential communication channels grows combinatorially with team size (~ *n*(*n*-1)/2 possible pairs). Without a structured approach, a naive expectation is that coordination effort could explode as a project grows ([The Relationship Between Software Development Team Size and Software Development Cost – Communications of the ACM](https://cacm.acm.org/research/the-relationship-between-software-development-team-size-and-software-development-cost/#:~:text=Software%20development%20project%20tools%20provide,a%20mute%20point%2C%20at%20best)). However, studies of real projects show that teams naturally don’t communicate in a fully connected manner; they evolve a network that is sparse yet effective. For instance, a study comparing developer email networks to issue comment networks in multiple OSS projects found that many network metrics remained **correlated with network size** (i.e. bigger projects had proportionally more edges, maintaining certain ratios) – the main differences were in specific metrics like clustering ([Analyzing Developer Networks Based on GitHub Issue Data](https://www.se.cs.uni-saarland.de/theses/RaphaelNoemmerBA.pdf#:~:text=consistent,We%20conclude%20that)). This means that when comparing metrics over time, you should account for the fact that some changes are a normal consequence of having more developers. What we’re looking for is *abnormal* changes (relative to team size) that indicate coordination complexity beyond linear growth.
- **Socio-technical Congruence:** Some research (e.g., Cataldo et al.) has examined how misalignment between the **coordination requirements** (implied by code dependencies) and the actual communication network can slow down work. While your focus is on the social graph itself, it’s worth noting that if certain parts of the code require coordination among many developers, the absence of corresponding edges in the communication network can be problematic. In practice, if you notice subgraphs in the developer network that correspond to tightly coupled code areas, high betweenness edges connecting them might be critical communication links. Studies have empirically shown that open-source developers do communicate to fulfill many coordination requirements that arise from code coupling ([](https://www.se.cs.uni-saarland.de/publications/docs/HSA+20.pdf#:~:text=semantic%20view%20on%20this%20phenomenon,code)) ([](https://www.se.cs.uni-saarland.de/publications/docs/HSA+20.pdf#:~:text=but%20also%20those%20arising%20from,This%20finding)) – but mostly for complex, critical parts of the system. Simpler coordination needs often get handled implicitly (without explicit communication) ([](https://www.se.cs.uni-saarland.de/publications/docs/HSA+20.pdf#:~:text=but%20also%20those%20arising%20from,This%20finding)). This kind of analysis might be beyond your immediate scope, but it provides context: a well-coordinated project is one where the developer network aligns well with the structure of the work.
- **Core-Periphery and Turnover:** Several analyses have looked at the division between **core contributors and peripheral contributors** using network centrality. For example, one study built two-mode networks of developers-to-files and developers-to-issues to identify core developers in code contributions vs core in community interactions ([Classifying Core Developers in Open-Source Software Projects](https://www.se.cs.uni-saarland.de/theses/PhilippScholtesBA.pdf#:~:text=In%20this%20thesis%2C%20we%20construct,group%20by%20their%20characteristics%20and)). They found that developers who are central in both the code-change network and the issue network tend to have the highest overall impact (commits, approvals, etc.) ([Classifying Core Developers in Open-Source Software Projects](https://www.se.cs.uni-saarland.de/theses/PhilippScholtesBA.pdf#:~:text=Our%20results%20indicate%2C%20that%20core,We%20use%20two%20indices%2C%20one)). Over time, newcomers transition through peripheral roles and may become core if they increase their centrality ([Classifying Core Developers in Open-Source Software Projects](https://www.se.cs.uni-saarland.de/theses/PhilippScholtesBA.pdf#:~:text=Using%20these%20five%20subgroups%2C%20we,developers%20who%20leave%20the%20core)). For your analysis, observing how the **degree distribution** or centrality distribution changes with more contributors could reveal if the project’s core is relatively shrinking (i.e., a few people can’t personally interact with an ever-growing periphery) – a potential coordination scaling issue. If the “center” of the network (high-degree nodes) does not expand while the network’s fringe grows, the headwind might manifest as delays or less effective onboarding (since core members become overloaded).
- **Tools and Datasets:** Performing this analysis for large projects is facilitated by tools and data sources. We already mentioned **NetworkX** for graph analysis. For data acquisition, **GH Archive** (a public archive of GitHub events) and **GHTorrent** ([](https://gousios.org/pub/ghtorrent-dataset-toolsuite.pdf#:~:text=2,participation%20to%20common%20projects%2C%20social)) ([](https://gousios.org/pub/ghtorrent-dataset-toolsuite.pdf#:~:text=3,and%20promotion%3A%20Researchers%20often%20ask)) are valuable. GHTorrent, for example, provides a unified database of GitHub activities (commits, issues, comments, etc.) with timestamps, which researchers have used to construct developer networks and study their evolution ([](https://gousios.org/pub/ghtorrent-dataset-toolsuite.pdf#:~:text=2,participation%20to%20common%20projects%2C%20social)). Using such datasets, one can extract the events of interest (e.g., all issue comments in a project, all commits with author info) and build graphs programmatically. There are also higher-level tools; for instance, **GrimoireLab** is a toolkit that can mine GitHub and produce contributor networks or metrics, and libraries like **igraph** or **networkx-metagraph** can handle larger graphs if needed. Visualization tools like **Gephi** can help in qualitatively inspecting the network for clusters or outlier nodes at different time slices (which can complement quantitative metrics).

Importantly, previous studies highlight that many OSS collaboration networks are **“scale-free”** or heavy-tailed in their degree distribution (a few developers have many connections, many have few) ([Analyzing Developer Networks Based on GitHub Issue Data](https://www.se.cs.uni-saarland.de/theses/RaphaelNoemmerBA.pdf#:~:text=Now%2C%20we%20examine%20the%20remaining%2C,We)) ([Analyzing Developer Networks Based on GitHub Issue Data](https://www.se.cs.uni-saarland.de/theses/RaphaelNoemmerBA.pdf#:~:text=The%20modularity%20value%20seems%20to,Owncloud%20being%20having%20a%20higher)). This implies that as projects grow, they don’t become uniformly interconnected; instead, new contributors often attach to well-connected individuals (like a preferential attachment process). This property can both help and hurt coordination: it helps by anchoring newcomers to experienced members (forming a star topology that keeps distance short), but it can hurt if those few hubs become overwhelmed. Thus, tracking how **hub workload** grows is critical.

## Interpreting Metric Trends for Coordination Headwind Insights

Finally, how do we relate changes in these graph metrics to the number of contributors and detect a potential **coordination headwind**?

A “coordination headwind” means that beyond a certain point, each additional contributor brings disproportionately less productivity due to increased coordination overhead. In network terms, the **effort to maintain connectivity and coherent work increases as the network grows**. Here are some guidelines on interpreting the metrics in relation to team size:

- **Edges vs. Contributors Scaling:** Ideally, as contributors increase, collaboration edges would increase such that each contributor maintains a reasonable number of connections (keeping average degree steady or slowly growing). If you observe that the number of edges grows **slower** than the number of nodes (e.g., average degree declines, density plummets), it implies each new person is interacting with fewer others on average. This could be initial onboarding (which is fine if they ramp up later) or a warning sign that communication isn’t scaling – possibly evidence of headwind. For example, going from 50 to 150 developers but seeing average degree drop from 5 to 3 means many new developers are not forming connections at the same rate; the core might not be able to keep up with engaging everyone.
- **Increasing Path Length:** If the average shortest path length in the network increases noticeably with team size, this suggests that information has to travel through more intermediaries. A jump in path length from ~2 to ~3 might sound small, but on a project mailing list or issue tracker it can translate to longer communication chains and more opportunities for miscommunication. A steady small-world property (path length ~ log N or lower) indicates that the project has introduced cross-links (through architecture or team structure) to curb distance. But if you see a trend that *L* is creeping up as N increases, the headwind may be building – coordination requires more steps. In extreme cases, the network might even split (path length effectively infinite between subgroups), which clearly hampers coordination.
- **Modularity and Fragmentation:** An upward trend in modularity with contributor count can reflect logical division of labor – which is natural and often necessary (you don’t want 200 people all working on one file). However, if modularity becomes very high and inter-module edges remain few, coordination across modules (e.g., integration of different components) might suffer. Watch for a combination of **rising modularity and rising path length** – that would indicate modules drifting apart with insufficient coordination, a sign of coordination headwind. On the other hand, if modularity rises but path length stays low, it means the project found a way to stay integrated (likely via core connectors or overlapping membership between teams).
- **Clustering and Team Mix:** If the global clustering coefficient declines as more people join, it might mean the project’s social cohesion is diluting – fewer triadic collaborations relative to the size of the group. Newcomers might only link to one mentor and not form triangles. This can be a warning that knowledge is not circulating broadly (everyone talks to the lead, but not peer-to-peer). Extremely high clustering in subgroups combined with high modularity could conversely mean cliques that might become echo chambers. For coordination efficiency, you’d like to see a moderate clustering that either stays constant or only dips slightly with large influxes of contributors. The earlier cited study noticed that clustering behavior can diverge for unknown reasons and did not strictly follow network size ([Analyzing Developer Networks Based on GitHub Issue Data](https://www.se.cs.uni-saarland.de/theses/RaphaelNoemmerBA.pdf#:~:text=global%20clustering%20coefficient%20,determine%20the%20cause%20of%20this)) – so use it as a qualitative signal in tandem with other metrics.
- **Core-Periphery Balance:** Track how the **core size vs. total size** changes. For instance, if initially 5 core maintainers interact with 15 contributors (1:3 ratio), and later 5 core maintainers interact with 100 contributors (1:20 ratio), the core is now a thin funnel. That likely indicates a headwind: a few people coordinating a vastly larger crowd, which can slow decision-making and reviews. In network metrics, this might show up as increasing centralization (few nodes with very high degree). If metrics like degree centralization or the share of edges incident to top 10% of nodes keep growing with team size, coordination load is concentrating. A healthy way to scale is to **grow the core** along with the team – i.e., new intermediate leaders or subteam coordinators emerge, which would show as more medium-to-high degree nodes, not just the original ones. So, look for whether the network’s degree distribution broadens (more people with high degree) or just stretches (the same people having even higher degree). The latter is a sign of potential trouble.
- **Productivity Correlation:** Although not a pure network metric, you might correlate these graph measures with project outcomes over time (e.g., release frequency, issue resolution time, or PR latency). If a rise in coordination metrics (like path length or centralization) coincides with slowdowns in merging PRs or increasing bug backlogs, that strengthens the evidence of a coordination headwind. Prior research often examines whether network structural measures correlate with performance; for example, an increase in required coordination (as deduced from who should talk, based on code dependencies) not matched by actual communication ties was shown to increase the resolution time of tasks ([](https://www.se.cs.uni-saarland.de/publications/docs/HSA+20.pdf#:~:text=semantic%20view%20on%20this%20phenomenon,code)). In your context, if after the team grows past a certain size you see, say, average PR review time doubling, check if at the same time the developer network became more complex or sparse.

In summary, an OSS project scaling up in contributors will ideally **maintain a small-world, integrated network**: relatively stable average degree (each person finds a few collaborators), short paths (thanks to core connectors), and moderate clustering/modularity (subteams exist but are well bridged). This scenario implies that while the coordination surface grows, the project absorbs new contributors without a huge hit to efficiency – there’s *some* headwind, but manageable. On the other hand, if you observe **densities plummeting, path lengths rising, and communication concentrating on overstretched hubs**, it suggests the coordination headwind is impeding the project. For instance, a new contributor might have trouble getting timely feedback if all communication routes lead through one or two busy people.

Using NetworkX, you can compute these metrics for each snapshot and then plot them against time or against the number of active contributors in that snapshot. Look for inflection points or clear trends. You may find, for example, that up to 50 contributors everything scales well, but beyond 100 contributors certain metrics degrade. By citing concrete measurements with references to known patterns (like those found in Angular or other studied projects), you can argue whether the “coordination headwind” is present in your target project. And if it is, the graph metrics will provide a quantitative backbone for that argument, in a way that purely qualitative observations cannot.
